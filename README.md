# The Bank Tech Test

### Requirements
The requirements for this tech test can be found [here](README_original.md) and [here](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Solving the challenge

* Following Agile Methodologies I began by writing user stories for each of the project's basic requirements. The list of user stories can be found [here](user_stories.md). As I complete each user story I will list it under the section entitled "Completed User Stories".

* Based upon the given instruction: "When in doubt, go for the simplest solution", I opted to begin by building my solution as a command line program in Ruby. The program will be developed test-first, and the tests will be written using Rspec.

* Seeing as the requirements specify that completing the challenge is not mandatory, however implementing Travis CI *is*, I opted to next begin work on implementing Travis CI with my repository. There was a good chance that implementing Travis CI could introduce some unforeseen complications, so I opted not to leave it until any later in the challenge.

###Completed User Stories

```
As a user,
So that I can store my funds,
I would like a bank account.
